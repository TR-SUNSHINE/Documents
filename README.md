# TechReturners Project Sunshine Document Repository

This document repository holds key documents created during the lifetime of the project. 

For example, it includes the project brief as well as meeting agendas and notes.   The presentation given at the first Sprint Planning session with the Product Owner and subsequent Sprint Reviews are included.  

Documents which are regularly updated during the lifetime of the project are kept in a Google folder, to enable easy access by all members of the team.  Some of these documents will be added to the repository at the end of the project.
